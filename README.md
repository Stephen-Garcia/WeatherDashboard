<h1 align="center">Weather Dashboard ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Created a dashboard that uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities that are searched for by user. Uses `localStorage` to store any cities that have been searched for prior and allows user to call them up quickly.  


**Live application deployed at: https://jpd61.github.io/weather-dashboard/**  

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
